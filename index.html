		For part A, I added a third light comming from the right side with a different color. The Taurus has the standard Phong shader.
		The box has both a texture applied to it and is affected by lighting. For the sphere, each vertex is displaced along its normal
		at a random distance. The color is based off of the amount it is displaced. The sphere is moving on a sin curve, and the displacement
		amounts are constantly being updated.

		For part B, I implemented a Gaussian Blur with kernel size of 7, and sigma of 2. It uses the two-pass method for better efficiency.

		For part C, I changed it so that it uses 4 states, and used the Perfect Spirals rules by David Griffeath.
